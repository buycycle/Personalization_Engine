- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitLab projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.

### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Recommendation? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:
- [Beginner issues](https://gitlab.com/buycycle/recommendation_content/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://gitlab.com/buycycle/recommendation_content/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=help+wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.
### Pull Requests
The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Recommendation's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Recommendation
- Enable a sustainable system for Recommendation's maintainers to review contributions
Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
1. Follow all instructions in [the template](https://gitlab.com/buycycle/recommendation_content/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Merge_Request.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your merge request, verify that all [status checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html) are passing
While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your merge request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your merge request can be ultimately accepted.
## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and merge requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
### Code Styleguide
- Use the coding conventions and standards established in the project.
- Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.
- Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style of the project to maintain consistency.
